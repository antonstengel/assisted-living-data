# assisted-living-data

Data and code for NeurIPS MLPH 2021 submission.

Dataset of assisted living facilities is `alf-dataset.csv`. It currently has 47 states and DC. We are working on adding the last three states.

Brief description of the repo:
- `notebooks` contains most of our code used to process, clean, and analyize the data. File paths are currently broken as files have been moved around.
- `data` contains other data files. `raw-state-data` contains the raw data gathered from all of the 48 states, as well as different stages of processing for each state's data.
- `county-data-for-replication` contains tables gathered from ACS data to replicate the past ALF study.
- `other-data` contains an assortment of other data files used throughout the process.
